  { id: 14, text: 'Could you ask the secretary if I might go in now & then (of a morning of course)? You can judge if he is a discreet man, who would not talk about the thing or make it notorious; one who in short could understand why & how I want to get entrée to their library in a quiet and unobtrusive manner… - a request of a friend for admittance to the Royal Society in 1844' },
  { id: 15, text: 'I am more than ever now the workhorse I have always been, and the more a great one.' },
  { id: 16, text: 'In considering any new subject, there is frequently a tendency, first, to overrate what we find to be already interesting or remarkable; and, secondly, by a sort of natural reaction, to undervalue the true state of the case, when we do discover that our notions have surpassed those that were really tenable' },

  { id: 19, text: 'I shall, in due time, be a Poet.' },
  { id: 20, text: 'Mathematical science shows what is. It is the language of unseen relations between things. But to use and apply that language, we must be able to fully to appreciate, to feel, to seize the unseen, the unconscious.' },
  { id: 21, text: 'The Analytical Engine, on the contrary, can either add, subtract, multiply or divide with equal facility; and performs each of these four operations in a direct manner, without the aid of any of the other three.' },
  { id: 22, text: 'We may say most aptly that the Analytical Engine weaves algebraical patterns just as the Jacquard-loom weaves flowers and leaves.' },
  { id: 23, text: 'Many persons who are not conversant with mathematical studies imagine that because the business of [Babbage’s Analytical Engine] is to give its results in numerical notation, the nature of its processes must consequently be arithmetical and numerical, rather than algebraical and analytical. This is an error. The engine can arrange and combine its numerical quantities exactly as if they were letters or any other general symbols; and in fact it might bring out its results in algebraical notation, were provisions made accordingly.' },
  { id: 24, text: 'Supposing, for instance, that the fundamental relations of pitched sounds in the science of harmony and of musical composition were susceptible of such expression and adaptations, the engine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent.' },
  { id: 25, text: 'We might even invent laws for series or formula in an arbitrary manner, and set the engine to work upon them, and thus deduce numerical results which we might not otherwise have thought of obtaining; but this would hardly perhaps in any instance be productive of any great practical utility, or calculated to rank higher than as a philosophical amusement.' },
  { id: 26, text: 'But the science of operations, as derived from mathematics more especially, is a science of itself, and has its own abstract truth and value; just as logic has its own peculiar truth and value, independently of the subjects to which we may apply its reasonings and processes.' },
  { id: 27, text: 'It may be desirable to explain, that by the word operation, we mean any process which alters the mutual relation of two or more things, be this relation of what kind it may. This is the most general definition, and would include all subjects in the universe.' },
  { id: 28, text: 'In enabling mechanism to combine together general symbols in successions of unlimited variety and extent, a uniting link is established between the operations of matter and the abstract mental processes of the most abstract branch of mathematical science.' },
  { id: 29, text: 'In almost every computation a great variety of arrangements for the succession of the processes is possible, and various considerations must influence the selections amongst them for the purposes of a calculating engine. One essential object is to choose that arrangement which shall tend to reduce to a minimum the time necessary for completing the calculation.' },
  { id: 30, text: 'The object of the engine is in fact to give the utmost practical efficiency to the resources of numerical interpretations of the higher science of analysis, while it uses the processes and combinations of this latter.' },
  { id: 31, text: 'The Analytical Engine is an embodying of the science of operations, constructed with peculiar reference to abstract number as the subject of those operations.' },
  { id: 32, text: 'A new, a vast, and a powerful language is developed for the future use of analysis, in which to wield its truths so that these may become of more speedy and accurate practical application for the purposes of mankind than the means hitherto in our possession have rendered possible.' },
  { id: 33, text: 'Thus not only the mental and the material, but the theoretical and the practical in the mathematical world, are brought into more intimate and effective connection with each other.' },
  { id: 34, text: 'It is not my wish to proclaim who has written it. I rather wish to append anything that may tend hereafter to individualize it & identify it, with other productions of the said A.A.L. To say the truth, I am rather amazed at them; & cannot help being struck quite malgré moi, with the really masterful nature of the style, & its Superiority to that of the Memoir itself.' },
  { id: 35, text: 'One result of feedback can be maturity. When we are mature, we neither under-guess nor over-guess.' },
  { id: 36, text: 'I never can nor will support you in acting on principles which I consider not only wrong in themselves, but suicidal. - correspondence to mentor, Charles Babbage. Date unknown.' },
  { id: 37, text: 'The Analytical engine] has no pretensions to originate anything, [but can] do whatever we know how to order it to perform. It can follow analysis; but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths…' },
  { id: 38, text: 'Can you undertake to give your mind wholly and undividedly, as a primary object that no engagement is to interfere with, to the consideration of all those matters in which I shall at times require your intellectual assistance and supervision; & can you promise not to slur & hurry things over, or to mislay & allow confusion & mistakes to enter into documentation &c? - correspondence to mentor, Charles Babbage. Date unknown.' },
  { id: 39, text: 'The intellectual, the moral, the religious seem to me all naturally bound up and interlinked together in one great and harmonious whole.' },
  { id: 40, text: 'Your best and wisest refuge from all troubles is in your science.' },
  { id: 41, text: 'It must be evident how multifarious and how mutually complicated are the considerations. There are frequently several distinct sets of effects going on simultaneously; all in a manner independent of each other, and yet to a greater or less degree exercising a mutual influence. To adjust each to every other, and indeed even to perceive and trace them out with perfect correctness and success, entails difficulties whose nature partakes to a certain extent of those involved in every question where conditions are very numerous and inter-complicated; such as for instance the estimation of the mutual relations amongst statistical phenomena, and of those involved in many other classes of facts.' },
  { id: 42, text: 'If we compare together the powers and the principles of construction of the Difference and of the Analytical Engines, we shall perceive that the capabilities of the latter are immeasurably more extensive than those of the former, and that they in fact hold to each other the same relationship as that of analysis to arithmetic.' },
  { id: 43, text: 'Indeed we may consider the engine as the material and mechanical representative of analysis, and that our actual working powers in this department of human study will be enabled more effectually than heretofore to keep pace with our theoretical knowledge of its principles and laws, through the complete control which the engine gives us over the executive manipulation of algebraical and numerical symbols.' },
  { id: 44, text: 'In so distributing and combining the truths and the formulae of analysis, that they may become most easily and rapidly amenable to the mechanical combinations of the engine, the relations and the nature of many subjects in that science are necessarily thrown into new lights, and more profoundly investigated. This is a decidedly indirect, and a somewhat speculative, consequence of such an invention. It is however pretty evident, on general principles, that in devising for mathematical truths a new form in which to record and throw themselves out for actual use, views are likely to be induced, which should again react on the more theoretical phase of the subject.' },
  { id: 45, text: '[I pray it] will not ultimately result in this generation’s being acquainted with these inventions through the medium of pen, ink , and paper merely, [but will have] various collateral influences, besides the main and primary objective attained.' },
  { id: 46, text: '[Although I] wished for heirs [I] never desired a child. [They are] irksome duties & nothing more.' },
  { id: 47, text: '[I possess] a total deficiency in all natural love of children.' },
  { id: 48, text: 'To tell the honest truth I feel the children much more nuisance than pleasure & cannot help remembering that I am not naturally or originally fond of children.' },
  { id: 49, text: '[My husband is] my chosen pet. [Though I am indifferent to any] mortal husband.' },
  { id: 50, text: 'No man would suit me, tho’ some might be a shade or two less personally repugnant to me than others.' },
  { id: 51, text: 'I now read Mathematics every day & am occupied on Trigonometry & in preliminaries to Cubic and Biquadratic Equations. So you see that matrimony has by no means lessened my taste for these pursuits, nor my determination to carry them on. – Letter to acclaimed mathematician, Mary Somerville. Date unknown.' },
  { id: 52, text: 'The passions suffer no less by this gaming fever than the understandings and the imagination. What vivid, unnatural hope and fear, joy and anger, sorrow and discontent burst out all at once upon a roll of the dice, a turn of the card, a run of the shining gurneys!' },
  { id: 53, text: 'Who can consider without indignation that all those womanly affections, which should have been consecrated to children and husband, are thus vilely prostituted and thrown away. I cannot but be grieved when I see the Gambling Lady fretting and bleeding inwardly from such evil and unworthy obsessions; when I behold the face of an angel agitated by the heart of a fury!' },
  { id: 54, text: 'Heaven knows what intense suffering & agony I have gone thro’; & how mad & how reckless & desperate I have at times felt.' },
  { id: 55, text: 'There has been no end to the manias & whims I have been subject to, & which nothing but the most resolute determination on my part could have mastered.' },
  { id: 56, text: 'No more laudanum has been taken as yet. But I doubt another twenty-four hours going over without. I am beginning to be excited, & my eyes burn again.' },
  { id: 57, text: '[I will take laudanum] not for ever, [but] as a regular thing once or twice a week.' },
  { id: 58, text: '[It has a] remarkable effect on my eyes, seeming to free them, & to make them open & cool.' },
  { id: 59, text: '[Opium] makes me so philosophical, & so takes off all fretting eagerness & anxieties. It appears to harmonize the whole constitution, to make each function act in a just proportion (with judgement, discretion, moderation).' },
  { id: 60, text: '[My doctor] seems to think it is not a mere palliative but has a far more radical effect. Since the last dose, I am inclined to think so myself..' },
  { id: 61, text: 'It is a pity that instead of ordering Claret some months ago, he had not advised laudanum or Morphine. I think he has got the thing at last.' },
  { id: 62, text: 'There is in my nervous system such utter want of all ballast & steadiness, that I cannot regard my life or powers as other than precarious.' },
  { id: 63, text: '[I have a] vast mass of useless & irritating POWER OF EXPRESSION which longs to have full scope in active manifestation such as neither the ordinary active pursuits or duties of life, nor the literary line of expression, can give vent to.' }, 
  { id: 64, text: 'There is no pleasure in way of exercise equal to that of feeling one’s horse flying under one. It is even better than waltzing.' },

  { id: 66, text: 'I never would look to the excellence of mere representation being satisfactory to me as an ultimate goal, or exclusive object…' },
  { id: 67, text: 'Many causes have contributed to produce the past derangements; & I shall in future avoid them. One ingredient (but only one among many) has been too much Mathematics.' },
  { id: 68, text: 'I am proceeding on a track quite peculiar and my own, I mean to do what I mean to do.' }, 
  { id: 69, text: 'Nothing but very close & intense application to subjects of a scientific nature now seems at all to keep my imagination from running wild, or to stop up the void which seems to be left in my mind from a want of excitement.' }, 
  { id: 70, text: '[I may never be coaxed into] dropping the thread of science, Mathematics &c. These may be still my ultimate vocation.' },
  { id: 71, text: 'You know I am a d—-d ODD animal! And as my mother often says, she never has quite yet made up her mind if it is the Devil or Angel, that watches peculiarly over me; only that it IS one or the other, without doubt! (And for my part, I am quite indifferent which.) December 1841.' },
  { id: 72, text: 'Certainly my troops must consist of numbers, or they can have no existence at all, & would cease to be the particular sort of troops in question.--But then what are these numbers? There is a riddle.' },
  { id: 73, text: 'This is very mathematical weather. When one cannot exercise one’s muscles out of doors, one is peculiarly inclined to exercise one’s brains in-doors.' },

  { id: 92, text: 'I wish I went on quicker. That is–I wish a human head, or my head at all event, could take in a great deal more & a great deal more rapidly that in the case;--and if I had made up my own head, I would have portioned its wishes & ambition a little more to its capacity… In time, I will do all, I dare say. And if not, why, it don’t signify, & I shall have amused myself at least - September 1840.' },
  { id: 93, text: 'And I am just the person to drop off some fine day when nobody knows anything about the matter or expects it… Do not fancy me ill. I am apparently very well at present.

  { id: 101, text: '[Because of] some peculiarity in my nervous system [I have] perceptions of some things, which no one else has; or at least, very few, if any. I can throw rays from every quarter of the universe into one vast focus. This faculty may be designated in me as a singular tact, or some might say an intuitive perception of hidden things;--that is of things hidden from eyes, ears & ordinary senses…' },

  { id: 104, text: 'A Newton for the Molecular Universe is a crying want; but the nature of the subject renders this desideratum of improbable fulfilment. Such a discovery (if possible at all), could only be made thro’ very indirect methods;--& would demand a mind that should unite habits of matter of fact reasoning and observation, with the highest imagination, a union unlikely in itself.' },
